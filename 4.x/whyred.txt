• If comes from encrypted state, you need to format first.
• You can use any recovery as encryption is broken right now.
• ROM comes with AIDL qti vibrator (LED based vibrator), so if you want to use custom kernel, then you'll need to use kernel with qti haptics driver or you'll not get any vibration. 
Ask the kernel developer if their kernel is support qti haptics driver if you want to use this rom with vibration.
