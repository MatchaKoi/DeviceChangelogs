‚Ä¢ Device Changelogs :
‚Ä¢ Switch to SiLont-but-basic:[v2] kernel
‚Ä¢ Improved screen recorder experience
‚Ä¢ And some underhood optimization

‚Ä¢ Notes :
‚Ä¢ Old cam build.
‚Ä¢ Use OrangeFox Recovery R11 by orges or latest Pitchblack/Twrp.
‚Ä¢ Use only magisk 23.0 and upward if available, else you will get safetynet API error message.
‚Ä¢ WFD might be difficult to connect with certain kernel.
‚Ä¢ Make sure to turn off blur to reduce jitter in status bar while doing gaming/screen recording or to improve system animation fluidness.
‚Ä¢ If you want to use magisk, don't forget to turn on magiskhide to make safetynet passed.
‚Ä¢ For gapps, recommended to use Nik or Flame, just don't install the full variant for Nik.
‚Ä¢ Use NikGapps build 3 July and later, as it is already fixed the backup script (so you won't need to reflash gapps everytime upgrade build)
‚Ä¢ Also please, don't install gapps which has packageinstaller like opengapps to avoid problem when uninstalling apps, like uninstall failed or force closed.
‚Ä¢ Don't install Nikgapps pixel launcher addons as it causing black screen, just install Flame Pixel Launcher or Pixel Launcher Magisk Module or MrSluffy ones instead if you want.
‚Ä¢ LDAC codec is not working on QTI Bluetooth because hardware limitation, just enable "Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload" in developer option if you're using headphone/iem/anything with LDAC codec.
‚Ä¢ Facing some package installer force closing? Might be worth to clear defaults/uninstall Termux, or ES File Manager, as they're having file handler that unfortunately 'steal' the default for package installer.
‚Ä¢ You have already read notes until this point? great, then you're make it to the top of 90% people who still asking why this or that feature doesn't working properly üëè.
