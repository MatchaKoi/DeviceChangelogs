• For Gapps selection on vanila build, use flamegapps basic or full variant, or NikGapps Core or Basic.
• Don't flash another custom kernel for now to avoid small issues with performance and storage, in worst scenario it will lead to bootloop and lost data.
• Don't flash PixelLauncher from Nikgapps, only install it from FlameGapps as from NikGapps ones is causing black screen after booted.
